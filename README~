ParrotBot
=========
Welcome to the ParrotBot github page! Just as a disclaimer, all parrots are completely virtual and no tropical birds were harmed in the making of this program.

ParrotBot does everythign you want it to. The only limit is yourself. You feed it a file called a learn file that it can read (and write to), it will perform analysis on it, talk to you, and learn from its mistakes. 

If you follow my projects you might think "Wow, this sounds a lot like C-response-system". Yeah, this is the rewrite of that. Now, I spent a lot of time on C-response-system, so 7 hours of programming will not create a product that can nearly rival C-response-system. Expect a lot of updates over the coming weeks on this, more heavy on the weekends.

Limitations over C-response-system
=================================
-It is prone to crashing (It has had a history of this, but it seems to have gotten better after I added sanitization)
-No Crunch
-No random responses
-No boot system
-No config file

Advantages over C-R-S
===================
-True Learning works a LOT better, simpler, and easier than it does in C-response system. Better: It can read am phrases, is phrases, and are phrases. simpler: The process that extracts the information is really terse thanks to LibHaskell. easier: All the user has to do is type learn: phrase for the bot to learn the phrase.
 
Features that will be implemented
=================================
-Config File
-Random Responses
-Special Commands
-REMOVE THE HACKS
-.deb file after maturation.

Plans for the future
=====================
Eventually I want this to become better than C-response-system (obviously, who wouldn't want a better C-response-system).

Towards the last few days of the C-response-system the code got really icky (especially around the plugin system) and that is why I am rewriting it for the THIRD time. I plan to not re-implement crunch, and that is such a service that I will call that a feature.

I will create a .deb when I feel the project has matured a bit.
