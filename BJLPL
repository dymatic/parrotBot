Preamble=
======
I am a programmer; not a law student. This license is an idea and not an implementation. I shouldn't have problems with companies wanting this code, and if they do this license will
not stop them from using it in whatever ways their lawyers see fit. The license is more of a code of ethics regarding the project.

Using

Redistribution
---
All users may freely redistribute exact copies of the code or executable, but not in a way to generate profit exceeding shipping fees imposed by whatever means the software is delivered.
Altered copies may also be distributed at the discretion of the author, and the author may charge for this product. Altered Copies may not be named "PreProcess" and the authors cannot claim that they are affilliated in any way with the author of the original source code unless otherwise instructed.

Definition of Altered
---
"Altered" source code refers to a feature added to the software that enables new functionallity in the library's forward-facing API, module, or executable. If the change to the code does not alter, improve, remove, or add functionallity it is not an altered copy.
