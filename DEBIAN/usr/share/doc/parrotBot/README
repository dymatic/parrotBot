===ParrotBot

Welcome to the ParrotBot github page! Just as a disclaimer, all parrots are completely virtual and no tropical birds were harmed in the making of this program.

ParrotBot does everythign you want it to. The only limit is yourself. You feed it a file called a learn file that it can read (and write to), it will perform analysis on it, talk to you, and learn from its mistakes. 

If you follow my projects you might think "Wow, this sounds a lot like C-response-system". Yeah, this is the rewrite of that. Now, I spent a lot of time on C-response-system, so 7 hours of programming will not create a product that can nearly rival C-response-system. Expect a lot of updates over the coming weeks on this, more heavy on the weekends.

===Limitations over C-response-system

-Some of the WING responses aren't always accurate. This is a problem from StatAnal and will be fixed.
-No Crunch
-No random responses
-No boot system
-No config file

===Advantages over C-R-S

-True Learning works a LOT better, simpler, and easier than it does in C-response system. Better: It can read am phrases, is phrases, and are phrases. simpler: The process that extracts the information is really terse thanks to LibHaskell. easier: All the user has to do is type learn: phrase for the bot to learn the phrase.

- Fuzzy search has been implemented, meaning that similar phrases will be returned. This is what AI WING tried to do. 
Features that will be implemented

-Config File
-Random Responses
-Special Commands
-REMOVE THE HACKS

===Plans for the future

This has required a lot of hacks (including writing a C++ program to append files to avoid lazy evaluation), so I want to clean them up AFTER the program is feature-complete.

===License

Like all of my projects, this is being licensed under the BJLPL.
